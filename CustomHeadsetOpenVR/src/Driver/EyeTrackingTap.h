// Eye tracking recon + tap (slice 3 foundation).
//
// vrlink publishes gaze into vrserver through driver-side IVRDriverInput:
// CreateEyeTrackingComponent once, then UpdateEyeTrackingComponent per sample.
// The GetGenericInterface detour vtable-hooks those two entries (see
// InterfaceHookInjector.cpp) and forwards every call here.
//
// This class has two jobs, deliberately the same code:
//  - recon: log which components get created (does vrlink create one at all,
//    under which identity, on which container/path) and throttle-log the
//    sample stream (values, rate, time offsets, valid-flag transitions).
//  - tap: stash the latest sample thread-safely so FrameComponentShim can read
//    it on the Present thread. This is the production gaze feed for the
//    dynamic pupil-swim pass later; recon just proves it live.
//
// Zero config: when nothing calls UpdateEyeTrackingComponent this does nothing
// and logs nothing (beyond component creation, which is the recon headline).
